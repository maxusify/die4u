# Codename `die4u`
Personal game project in making with Bevy Engine. 
`die4u` is space simulator alike with elements of RPG, RTS and rhythm games. 
For now it is in really early stage of development (implementing core).

## Build
You can build the core game yourself by cloning this repository and running it with Rust `nightly` toolchain:
```bash
cargo run
```

## About game concept
You are a capitan of small space ship. Scavenging and doing small dirty jobs is not enough for you.
Take matters into your own hands and secure a bright future as a freighter captain, combat king, business shark or commander of your own organization.
Upgrade, expand and improve everything you have in your hands to make your dream come true.
But it won't be easy as you can guess... Others will do anything to prevent it happening. Space anomalies may be also a problem...
